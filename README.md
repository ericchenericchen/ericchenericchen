Hi!

This is a test, I'm Eric Chen, CECS student at USC, born in SLC ⛰️ and now in LA 🌴.

I do hardware stuff, software stuff (the second one better probably).
- Web dev (full stack)
- Blockchain
- Robotics
- Want to do other stuff

Anyways. Big. Huge. Tremendous, even.
I'm testing Vercel rn, hopefully it works 🤞!
